        My primary value is learning.  Learning means many things and takes on many forms.  I would summarize it as the process of creating and refining models that approximate reality.  People are always engaged in this process to a certain degree and it is especially common amongst children.  For example, children develop reasonable approximations for mechanics and thermodynamics in only a few years.  A child will learn that a ball rolls and liquids flow, that both tend to go downhill, and that the ball is broken once it splits into pieces while the liquid can come apart and go back together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process can be carried further through formal education.  A person can learn not just that a ball rolls downhill, but how it rolls.  Then it becomes possible to answer specific questions about the ball.  How quickly will it reach the bottom of hill?  Would it get there sooner or later if it were heavier?  And further still we can learn why the ball rolls downhill - gravity.

        All of us need to understand at least the basic consequences of mechanics to get through the day.  We rely on it for the simplest of tasks.  However, whether your knowledge is that of a child or a physics professor, you still only have a approximation of reality; we have yet to perfectly model any aspect of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what's they point?  Why continue to refine our approximations?  Do we really need to be able to explain how the ball will roll down the hill in extreme detail?  Continuing to refine a model tends to have diminishing returns in the short term and most people know this.  Going to school for one day or one class has basically no effect on your life even if it does improve your understanding of a particular topic.  And most people need a days work to result in a measurable effect on their life.  There are bills to pay.

        However, if we each only worried about today, then we would still be gathering our food from the forest.  Even farming requires an understanding that todays work might be better spent on tomorrows benefit.  But, if I am going to farm today and not get the food until harvest season, then I still need something to eat today.  If I don't already have todays food, then I would be better off gathering my food from the forest.  Learning is the same way - you lose value each day until you eventually regain that value many times over.

        Except that learning is much less obvious.  You can watch plants grow, but it is hard to tell whether or how much better you are at math than when the school year started.  On the other hand, learning does not have a predefined harvest season.  You can sow and reap value in many different ways and at many different times.

        I believe in continuously learning which creates a rather odd lifestyle.  It requires a certain level of wealth because you want to spend part each day creating value for a later day.  However, once you have been doing it a while, it also means that each day you will receive the value you created on a previous day.  Of course, it does not exactly work out to days, but you get the idea.  It is rather like the saas business model.  High initial implementation costs that create recurring revenue.  Once there is a decent amount of recurring revenue, it can be spent on addition implementation costs that again create recurring revenue and you have a cycle of increasing revenue.  One of the hard parts of saas is finding more customers, and similarly with learning you are always trying to use what you learned from a previous teacher to create enough value to help you find the next teacher.

        Continuous learning has an odd effect on identity as well.  If all goes according to plan, then your abilities will always be improving.  This is cause for great optimism.  But it also means you are less capable today than you will ever be.  And it turns out that every day is today, so you are always less capable than you will ever be.  Overall it does help shrug off the judgements that come from society though.  If someone says I'm not good enough, well today maybe I'm not good enough.  But they just gave me a suggestion for what to learn next.
