      <h2>What is the internet and how do I design/develop for it?</h2>
      <h4>12/14/14</h4>

        Part of Dev Bootcamp so far was learning to make a simple website with HTML and CSS.  I learned a lot and I enjoyed making a website, but it could look better if I was better at this.  I know you can use <code>@media</code> queries in CSS to apply different styling depending on user specific details, but I haven't worked with them yet.  So my site looks alright on my laptop and everything is too small on my phone.

        Responsive design is a popular topic lately.  I think it will be important for me to learn responsive design and I think it will be important for the entire internet to get used to.  There are plenty of articles, such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/03/26/why-you-need-to-prioritize-responsive-design-right-now/">this one</a>, which suggest that responsive design can have a significant positive return on investment.  And this makes sense.  I remember a few years ago basically every mobile website was awful.  You would do a google search on your phone, find an article, click the link, and it would bring you to the home page of that website instead of the page with the article.  Now the experience on a phone is better, but there are still plenty of sites which are clearly intended for larger devices.

        So many internet users have a different experience than me though.  I started using the internet in the 90's.  At first my family had one computer that we  shared.  It was much slower and could do less than my current phone.  Now I use a laptop, a desktop, and a smartphone every day.  I replace each of my computers every few years and the number I have access to only seems to keep growing.  On the other hand, so many internet users are coming online today and they aren't doing it on a Macbook.  When someone uses the internet for the first time, they are most likely using a phone and it is most likely the only computer they have access to.

        I think we need to consider the internet as a whole.  What really is the internet?  How are humans interacting with the internet and how are those interactions changing over time?  The number of internet users <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/">has more than doubled in the past 10 years</a> and it is only going to keep growing.  In 2005 there were about 1 billion internet users (16% of world population) and today there are about 3 billion (40% of world population).

        As I learn to design and develop for the internet I want to understand responsive design because I want people to enjoy and value my work whether they are holding the newest Macbook or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100">Nokia 1100</a>.  But I only know what it feels like to switch back and forth between a laptop and a smartphone.  I have no idea what the internet feels like when you have only seen it on the screen of a Nokia 1100.  I could buy a feature phone, but that isn't really the point.  I don't know what a significant portion of internet users think of and want from the internet.  I don't know how they feel.  For example, <a href="http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/africas-farming-revolution-starts-here/36849#b11g26t20w14">farmers</a>; I have no idea what a farmer wants from the internet.  The fact that she is using WhatsApp makes sense.  Everyone wants to communicate.  But they must have ideas for the internet I would never consider.  Perhaps communication is a strong enough common ground to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet is arguably the most powerful communications technology humanity has ever seen.  We can communicate with the 40% of people that are online.  But until we learn to understand each other, we will probably continue to unintentionally section off the internet with language and culture.  What do we do?  How do we become familiar with one another?

        If it were up to me I would choose to aggressively improve infrastructure.  The goal would be to enable every person to be an internet user if they choose to.  I think the internet has the potential to create common wants and common behaviors among all people.  Having a portion of your culture shared with everyone other person could be revolutionary.  Everyone would be worried about at least some of the same social, economic, and political issues.  I think if everyone used the internet, then we would be significantly better equipped to understand what the internet really is.  We would have a far better grasp of how we want it change over time and what we should learn so we can change it.  Not to mention expanding infrastructure everywhere could improve many global issues.
