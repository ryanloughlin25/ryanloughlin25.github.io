        Shereef's restaurant vs. kitchen idea makes a lot of sense to me.  I can relate to both mindsets, but I'm not sure the mindsets conflict.  It seems like they might be able to conexist.  Here's my perspective from those two mindsets.

        The restaurant.  I am currently a python developer on a data warehouse team.  I spent some time looking for other positions and found that I am only qualified for other data positions, but I am interested in many development roles - web and design; devops, automation, and scale; analytics and data.  DBC seems like a great way to learn rails, html, etc and make a transition to a different type of role in the software industry.  I was to broaden my skill set, advance my career, and find something new to enjoy.

        The kitchen.  I was always one of the better students in school, but never the best.  I liked studying, but I did not like school; It took me a long time (until college really) to understand that there was a difference between studying and school.  Studying is intelligence training just like exercise is athletic training.  Schools require you to study so you can pass a test so you can continue to study, but students often struggle to understand why studying is worthwhile and they lose interest.  And the tests often make no sense; why does a child with a passion for art need to pass an algebra test to go to art school?  Now I like algebra and I feel that a basic understand of algebra is critically important for everyone, but if you struggle with algebra that should not prevent you from learning to draw.  But I digress, I am excited to study in an environment that values communication and practical displays of skill and knowledge over memorization and "right answers."  I want to learn for the sake of self improvement rather than to get the grade.  I have no idea what to expect, but it sounds like DBC is designed the way I think a school should be designed.
