      <h2>Class example</h2>
      <h4>12/19/14</h4>
      <p>
        My example class is meant to mimic a simple stopwatch with 3 buttons - start, stop, and reset.  I will describe each method in the class and you can view the code <a href="../ruby/stopwatch.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the <code>initialize</code> method.  The <code>Stopwatch class</code> does not accept arguments.  It has 3 instance variables - <code>@accumulated</code>, <code>@start_time</code>, and <code>@status</code>.  <code>@accumulated</code> represents the total time from previously starting/stopping the stopwatch.  <code>@start_time</code> is a timestamp of the last time the watch was started.  <code>@status</code> can be either <code>:running</code> or <code>:stopped</code> depending on whether the watch is running.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>start</code> method only does anything is the watch is current stopped.  If it is stopped, then it will update <code>@status</code> to <code>:running</code> and record the current time in <code>@start_time</code>.  This lets the watch keep track of how much time has passed since <code>start</code> was called.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>stop</code> method only does anything if the watch is currently running.  If it is running, then it will update <code>@status</code> to <code>:stopped</code> and add the different between the current time and <code>@start_time</code> to <code>@accumulated</code>.  This way the watch will store previously accumulated time even if it is started again later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>reset</code> method sets all instance variables back to their initial state as though initialize had just been called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the <code>time</code> method will return the current time that would be displayed on the face of a stopwatch.  If the watch is stopped, then the <code>time</code> method will simply return <code>@accumulated</code>.  If the watch is running then the <code>time</code> method will return the different between the current time and <code>@start_time</code> plus <code>@accumulated</code>.
