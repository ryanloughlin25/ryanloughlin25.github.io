          I am concrete random and abstract sequencial according to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc's thinking styles</a>.  It is a surprisingly accurate list of qualities that describe how I think, work, and learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_mindset_and_growth_mindset">growth vs fixed mindset</a> is a simple explanation of why some people never seem to change and others go through radical transformation.  I only recently learned the terminology "growth mindset," but I think I have been doing it for a while.  In fact, I have lost count of the number of people who were mad at me when I said I do not think anyone is inherently bad at math.  Anyone can learn math if they have a good teacher and are willing to put in the effort.  It is just that it takes most people literal years to learn to do well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Gregorc's thinking styles and Dweck's mindsets are valueable ideas, but I think they do not completely define my thinking or learning style.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand how to think and how to learn.  At first it was unintentional.  I liked math and science classes in school from a young age.  I inevitably developed specific thinking and learning styles that are well suited to math and science because I spent so much time working on those topics.  It turns out the skills suited to math and science are also well suited to thinking and learning in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I intentionally try to use the scientific method to guide my thinking.  The wikipedia page about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a> describes it well, but people who are not already familiar with the scientific method generally do not find the formal description of it that useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of steps in the scientific method varies depending who you ask, but everyone is usually describing the same overall process.  I like to think about 4 main steps - question, hypothesize, experiment, and communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question should be straightforward.  All you have to do is question something.  It can be anything, but usually the more specific the better.  Also don't just question things that confuse you.  It is important to be open to questioning things you think you already understand.  As an example, we could ask why is the sky blue?   Next we try to answer our question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hypothesize is a fancy word for coming up with an explanation that answers the question.  So maybe the sky is blue because it reflects the color of the ocean.  Then we need to analyze our answer and try to think about everything our answer suggests.  If the sky is blue because it reflects off the ocean, then what else would that mean?  Well it should mean water is blue.  Now we have a prediction - water is blue - and we can test that prediction.
        </p>
        <p>
          An experiment is a controlled test to try to learn more about our prediction.  We can perform a simple experiment for our example by looking at water in other places to see if water is always blue.

          </div>
          So we see some examples where water is not blue and, as far as we know, the sky is always blue.  Come to think of it water out of the tap isn't blue either.  Now we know water isn't always blue, but the oceans are still blue.  So maybe the sky is still blue because oceans are blue.  But why are oceans blue then?  Another question for another time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally you must communicate you results.  Science is hard.  All this thinking and designing experiments.  We want to make sure other people know what questions we are asking and what we are doing to answer those questions.  This way people can repeat our work and try to verify the results.  Verification is important because anyone can say they know why the sky is blue.  For example, "I know it's blue because I made it blue."  You probably don't believe me though and you shouldn't.  An important part of science is that we are skeptical of each other's results.  You have to share your work so I can check it or I won't believe you.
        </p>

          We didn't make much progress on learning why the sky is blue, but we did get to see that pink lake and that was cool.  If people repeat the scientific method enough times then it usually results in good answers to hard questions.  If you want to know what the scientific community currently believes about the sky being blue, then check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering#Reason_for_the_blue_color_of_the_sky">Rayleigh scattering</a>.  It's pretty complicated though.  The short version is it has to do with the way sunlight interacts with the air.  And it really is a great answer.  It even describes why the sky is pink/red some evenings.
