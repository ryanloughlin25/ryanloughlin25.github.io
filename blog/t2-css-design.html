      I was confused as I tried to learn about the position property in CSS.  The position property seems quite useful, but I think it is difficult to understand because of the terminology that was chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the resources I read online only said that static positioning is normal or default positioning.  That didn't really help me understand anything; there is no normal when you started working with something a week ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I found http://learnlayout.com/position.html which I recommend.  It says that by default an element is not positioned or static.  This helped me a lot, but is still somewhat confusing. An element can literally have a position proprety set to static, but is referred to as not positioned.  So static means not positioned and there are three types of positioned - relative, absolute, and fixed.  Once you set a postion type you can use the properties top, right, botttom, and left to move the element around.  What top, right, bottom, and left do depends on the position type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed seems the simplest to me so let's start there.  Fixed means the element won't move with the page when the user scrolls the page.  You set a location and the element will stay there.  So if you want a box to always stay in the top left corner, then you would set position to fixed, top to 0, and left to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relative means display the element in relation to where it would have been if it was static.  You set a location and it moves over by that much, but it feels kind of backwards at first.  If you set position to relative and left to 20px, then it will create a space of 20px to the left of the element and the element will appear 20px to the right of where it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute confused me for a few days.  I disagree with the name that was chosen, but it is what it is so the best I can do is explain what confused me.  From google one definition of the word absolute is "viewed or existing independently and not in relation to other things; not relative or comparative." which basically says that absolute means not relative.  However, in CSS, absolute is a second type of relative.  That's not confusing at all right?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common description of absolute I found is that absolute means relative to the element's closest positioned ancestor.  I will try to break that down.  First elements are often inside of other elements.  In fact, any element we are trying to position should be inside of body.  So if we have a paragraph in a div in body, then the div is the paragraph's parent and body is the paragraph's grandparent.  Parents, grandparents, and so on are ancestors.  And your parent is a closer ancestor than your grandparent.  Now we want the closest positioned ancestor.  Positioned means an element has the position property set to fixed, relative, or absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if we set an element's position to absolute it means we are displaying the element relative to one of it's ancestors.  Specifically the closest ancestor which has its position property set to fixed, relative, or absolute.  Like I said it took me a few days to wrap my head around it.  If it still doesn't make sense, then I recommend creating a page with a few divs.  Give the divs different background-colors so you can tell them apart and play around with the different position values.  I find that practical examples really help.
