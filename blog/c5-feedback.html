      <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
      <h4>12/18/14</h4>
      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <p>
        Pairing has been a strange experience so far.  Most of my experience with programming has been by myself.  Even when I had group projects in school we would split up the work and work on our own pieces alone.  We only worked together when one person needed help with their share of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with someone else on code is still uncomfortable for me, but I can tell it is valuable.  The hardest part right now is trying to gauge the other person's understanding of the material so we can move at a reasonable pace.  I have more experience with programming that most of the students. I often understand what to do next when the other person would benefit from an explanation.  I am struggling to understand how to contribute without moving to fast.  I think it will be less of a problem once we are working in person beceause everyone will have a bit more experience.

        Also I dislike remote pairing.  A number of exercises really don't make sense when you aren't sharing a computer.  If one person is driving and creating files on their computer, then the other person doesn't have those files.  When you try to switch roles the new driver doesn't have the files (and we aren't sharing a repository).  Again this will be less of a problem in person.

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        So far most of the feedback I recieved has been about what I taught the other person and that they liked working with me.  I am happy to help people learn, but I prefer constructive feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were two pieces of constructive feedback that I really had to think about.  The first was that I moved too quickly for the person I was pairing with and they would have liked me to share resources with them.  I definitely need to work on keeping pace with my partner, but sharing resources is hard.  For example, I understand what a hash is because I first learned about it years ago while most of the other students have little to no experience with hashes.  And so I don't have a resource explaining hashes to share.  I could explain it myself, but I'm never sure when the other person wants me to explain and when they don't.  I guess I just need to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was that I am writing Ruby like it is python.  I was working with python prior to DBC so this feedback was spot on, but I hadn't realized it before someone told me.  Since then I have focused my time on the refactoring part of the challenges. I want to develop an opinion of how the logic should be expressed in Ruby and generally get more familiar with the tools available in Ruby.  I think I am making good progress, but it will probably take a while.  I am glad someone gave me that feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find writing feedback to be difficult.  I know I prefer constructive criticism over praise, but most people in our society feel the opposite.  This makes it difficult for me to decide how much to say about what someone did well and how much to say about what someone did poorly.  In fact, in the US you usually aren't even supposed to say "you did poorly at blah because blah."  You are expected to say something like "you could improve on blah because blah."
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing has helped a lot with writing feedback, which is the focus on specific, actionable, and kind feedback.  I think specific and kind are important, but the reminder to give actionable feedback helps me a lot.  I know I am giving useful feedback if I can say "you can improve at blah by doing blah," but I often forget how important it is to offer a suggestion for what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I think pairing and feedback are kind of awkward and don't feel like they are helping right now.  But they are helping.  We are building good habits and those habits will be important when we work together in person.
