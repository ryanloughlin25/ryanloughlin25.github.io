      <h2>What is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
      <h4>1/8/2015</h4>

        During undergrad I read about a few studies on the topic, but I never knew it had a name.  One study I remember in particular was about asian, female students.  There were 3 groups of students and all 3 groups were given the same set of math problems and the same time limit.  The first group was not told why they were asked to work on the problems.  The second group was told the researchers were studying whether there was any truth to the stereotype that asian people tend to be better than others at solving math problems.  The third group was told the researchers were studying whether the was any truth to the stereotype that women tend to be worse than men at solving math problems.  The results were, on average, that the first group's scores were in the middle, the second group's scores were below the first group, and the third group's score were above the other two groups.

        These results really surprised me.  The idea that you could improve or harm a person's performance on a task by telling them something they already know seems plainly wrong.  The students definitely knew their race and gender before they exam.  It seems reasonable to believe they knew about various stereotypes before the exam and, even if some of the didn't, enough should already know the stereotypes that this doesn't affect the results.  And yet here is a studying showing that student's scores were affected by being told things they already know.

        I was a computer science student not a psychology student.  I didn't talk to many people about this study and I accepted it as something I didn't understand.  I didn't realize it wasn't just a couple studies with an odd result, but rather a thriving field of research about a serious problem affecting most people.

        My first reaction to reading about stereotype threat was surprise that I could not think of a time I had experienced it.  This caused me to spend a few days thinking about it before I knew what to write about.  I think I never worried whether I would confirm stereotypes because I rarely worried about other people's judgements of me in general.

        I was the type of student who didn't care for grades or test scores.  I always felt like grades and test scores were a waste of time and the people who obsessed over them were missing the point.  The point of school is to learn.  With that attitude it kind of makes sense that I felt stereotype threat less than other people.  If someone told me "I think you will do poorly because ..." then I responded "I don't care.  What will I learn today?"  And if someone told me "I think you will do well because ..." then I responded "Great, but what will I learn today?"  Because, the thing is, whether I do well today is usually not what matters.  What matters is whether I am improving over time.  I think my perspective is uncommon.

        People tend to focus on what they feel.  When a person focuses on how they feel, they tend to focus on the present moment or the past. They focus less on what behaviors their feelings will tend towards and what outcomes those behaviors will tend towards.  If, instead, a person focuses on the future, then they tend to focus on outcomes.  Focusing on outcomes naturally leads to trying to determine which behaviors will lead to those outcomes and then experimenting to determine whether those behaviors work and how they feel.

        This makes me think maybe stereotype threat is a specific case of a more general set of behaviors.  Consider a thought experiment.  A classroom is given an exam.  As the teacher places an exam on some student's desks, the teacher makes a comment about how the student will perform.  So some students are told something like "Great job on the last assignment," some students are told "You've been making a lot of mistakes on your assignments recently," and some students are not told anything.  How do you think each student feels as they begin the exam?  How do you think those feelings will affect their performance in the short term?  When you think about it, the language and culture surrounding grades and standardized exams basically pretends people don't have feelings.  I know plenty of students who had a terrible morning the day of their SAT and performed poorly as a result.  No one says well that makes sense, you had a bad day.  Everyone says take the exam again and do better next time or you will be less likely to get into universities.  Again, how does that feel?

        And it's not just about school.  If you are going to give a presentation at work and, just before you begin, your boss says "I hope this goes better than last time," then how do you feel?  How does that affect your performance?
