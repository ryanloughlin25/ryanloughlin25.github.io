      <h2>my first job</h2>
      <h4>1/23/2015</h4>
      <p>
        After undergrad, my first job involved working as a back end developer using python and MySQL.  I had started teaching myself python towards the end of school and I had taken one SQL class, but it had been a couple years and I couldn't write a simple join without looking up the syntax.  This was great news for me.  Not only did I have a job (i.e. an income), but I was both able and expected to learn new skills at that job.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first month I didn't get much done, but I did implement a new feature.  It was mostly SQL so the queries left a lot to be desired.  It worked though and I was excited.  Suddenly I got a big project to clean out a significant amount of data.  We were cancelling a license for one data set and replacing it with another.  This was terrifying because the team was mainly responsible for integrating new data and had no tools for cleaning old data.  Also we could not simply rebuild the database from scratch because other teams depended on our row ids staying the same over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I spent a few months learning as much as I could about both MySQL and our schema.  I read all queries in our core processes and the python that drove them.  There was no documentation so I choose an entry point, started reading, and ran a lot of random scripts to see what they did.  After a few iterations, another engineer and I came up with a workable plan to remove the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next I worked on a project to integrate a publicly available government dataset.  We had some of the data from that dataset through business partners and it became clear that we should start loading all of it ahead of time rather than continuing to get it in pieces from multiple sources.  This was an intense learning experience.  I did not have a clear direction to go in integrating the data.  We simply knew that customers were going to continue to need parts of it, and each customer was likely going to need it for a slightly different purpose, so I needed to figure out what the full data included and how we could use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall it went well.  I learned a lot about MySQL and how to navigate and relate schemas created by different organizations for storing the same data.  After that project I worked primarily on customer implementations.  At first this was because it was the company's busy season, then it was because we were growing faster than planned.  Eventually it became clear that my job had become customer implementations - there were always more customers on the initial roadmap than we could handle in a quarter and some of them always got pushed to next quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer implementation didn't excite me and, probably more importantly, with too many to do there was always something that should have been done yesterday and my learning rate slowed significantly.  Although I guess that isn't fair.  I still learned a lot, but not what I wanted to learn.  So much of the work became talking.  What will we build, when will we build, how much will it cost?  I spent a limited amount of time writing, reading, and maintaining code and my technical skills stagnated.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was learning a lot about business and there seemed to be a real opportunity for me on the management track.  I spent a lot of time trying to learn about management.  I spoke to many of the engineering managers and asked them all the same questions - What's you background?  How did you become a manager?  What do you like and dislike about it?  I decided I wanted to continue learning technical skills and it seemed like management skills and technical skills were mutually exclusive.  Or at least that was the general opinion where I worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were other issues, but I think not having time to learn about and improve my technical skills was the main reason I decided to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took months to make the decision and follow through on it.  It's a relatively short time over the course of life, but it's a long time for your emotions to build on each other.  I went from a role I was passonate for to a role I did not want.  I was frustrated, especially because I didn't choose the change.  I take work seriously because I see it as one of the best ways to learn.  School was always two things to me, learning and grades.  I felt like the grades and the judgement that a grade implies were a burden, but I could learn so much if I spent my time in the right ways.  Work is the same thing.  Some part of it will be a pain, but it also a great opportunity.  One of the best ways to learn is to choose a goal, formulate a plan, execute the plan, and either acheiving the goal or fail.  And thats what work is - goals, plans, and outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I take work seriously because it provides opportunities to learn using resources I otherwise would not have access to.  But work doesn't just mean my job.  To me work means anything you do to achieve a long term goal.  For many people the goal is finanical security so work and job mean the same thing.  For me the goal is currently learning so work can take many forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot from my first job.  There's one lesson I focus on a lot right now though, which is that each person should define the word success.  If I want to be successful, then only I can say what that means.  It could be money, control, and status.  Or it could be mastering a skill.  Or building loving relationships with family.  Or traveling the world.  And it could be many things all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if I let society define the word success for me, then the metrics for success will be the number on my bank statement and the prestige of my job title.
