        How many hours do you work and why?  There are only a few answers that most people provide to this question.  Some common examples are "I work as many hours as my boss will give me," "I have a 9 to 5 job," and "my startup needs me to work 80 hours a week."  I really like this question, but I dislike these answers.  The first answer means I need more hours because I need the money; the second answer means 40 hours per week is normal; and the third answer means I am working towards a purpose that matters to me.  These are all fine opinions, but they don't answer the question I was really trying to ask.  I really want to talk about the ideal work schedule.

        I think I usually don't get the conversation I want because of the effort I put into the question.  I asked a simple, one sentence question with no context and got a simple, one sentence answer with an everyday context.  If I instead explained why I think the question is important and walk through the thought I have put into it so far, then anyone who listened long enough to hear my thoughts would naturally engage in thinking about the problem and share their thoughts.  So this is what I intend to do here because I think the effort you put into asking a question is similar to the effort you will get out of the person answering the question.

        Do you know how or when the 40 hour work week started?  The short version is that the industrial revolution created jobs in factories.  Factory owners had the power to require workers to work for many hours, sometimes as much as 16 hours for 6 days per week.  Workers organized and started arguing for, among other things, jobs that required fewer hours.  This movement started around 200 years ago and the 40 hour work week started becoming common 75-100 years ago.  Since then our societies have mostly refined the rules of 40 hour work week.

        This is all good if for no other reason than the working conditions of the first factories were dangerous.  But it does make me wonder what 40 hours has to do with trying to write software.  There is plenty of attention around the idea that working too much causes burnout, mistakes, and ultimately lower productivity.  Do we have any evidence that 40 hours is actually ideal?  Even if we think 40 hours is more productive than 80, that doesn't tell us whether 30, 40, or 50 hours would be most productive.  Startups could be especially interesting here because they have the freedom to get creative with work schedules.  Sadly they usually choose the unprodutive 80 or the normal 40.

        So I return to the original question, and answers, with some context.  How many hours do you work and why?

        If you work as many hours as you can get, then I think that is an issue with wages not hours.  My personal opinion is that minimum wage (and really any wage below median income) should be significantly higher.  Doubling it would be a good start and then we would need to observe the results to decide whether it was enough.  Many people tend to think that raising minimum wage would cause more problems than it would solve, but this is a debate worth having.  If you are interested in this topic, I recommend reading about Ford's business plan and revenue in 1914.

        If you work a 9 to 5, then I ask you the same questions I ask myself.  Does the work you do really require 40 hours?  If your job involves communicating with people at other companies on a regular basis, then maybe you do need to be there 9 to 5 Monday through Friday because that's when they are working.  But wouldn't that still be true if they worked 9 to 7 Monday through Saturday?  This is a matter of just doing what everyone else does.  And for many jobs communication is not the main job function.  Many people spend plenty of time at work socializing (how often do your coworkers check Facebook at work?) or otherwise not actually working.  How many of the 40 hours do you spend productively?  If the answer is 32 or less then I would argue your employer should offer you Fridays off with pay in exchange for being able to demand real work during all of your work hours.  It seems like it would result in employees being both happier and more productive.  There are many other ways that productivity could be organized.  This is just an example to point out that we usually focus on hours at the office rather than hours doing work.

        Overall, I like to think about this questions and have these conversations because I am trying to understand my own career.  How many hours do I want to work and why?  It's hard to say because I don't know what I want to do.  I mean I know I want to write code, I enjoy that.  So I know what I want to do with my days, but I don't know what I want to do with my years or decades.  I could try to be a freelance developer so that I have the time to travel.  Or I could work a normal 9 to 5 at a big company so I can afford a house.  Or I could do whatever a startup wants and play the IPO lottery in the hope of a bigger house.  Or I could try to solve a problem by working at an organization like the Gates Foundation or <a href="https://watsi.org/">Watsi</a> and not worry about hours/money so much.  Or I could start a company and get creative it.

        This question has so many answers and none of them are right, they're all just different.  I that's what makes a decision hard.  When you know all the choices are fine, none obviously better or worse, and you still have to pick something.  Really you aren't choosing a good or a service, but choosing who you want to be.
